# Project Submission Guidelines

## Requirements

### 1. GitHub Repository
You will submit your project on GitHub. Ensure you have an account and know how to share a public repository. Follow these steps to set up your repository:
1. Create a new repository on GitHub.
2. Add your project files to the repository.
3. Ensure your repository is public.

### 2. Video Walkthrough
You will record a video of 5 minutes or less. In the video:
1. Share your screen and do a code walkthrough, explaining your code.
2. Run your code while continuing to share your screen.
3. Explain the resulting output.
   - Note: We will accept just audio with a screenshare, but we highly recommend doing the video and screenshare since it will better prepare you for job interviews.

### 3. Transaction ID
For some assessments/projects, you will need to share a transaction ID. This project does not require a transaction ID.

## Submission Instructions

2. Record a video walkthrough as described above.
